Scripts used in the **'Cancer type classification in liquid biopsies based on sparse mutational profiles enabled through data augmentation and integration'** manuscript.


# Data augmentation on sparse data
  *Used PCAWG .vcf files are available upon request from the ICGC data portal*
  
  Sparse SNV samples can be generated with the following script:
  
  Individual sparse samples then need to be merged into a final input data matrix (see examples in 'data').
